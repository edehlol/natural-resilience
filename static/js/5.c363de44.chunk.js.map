This test is useful in identifying strong points—where\n              one can help others most directly, and weak areas—where the lowest hanging fruit is.\n              Developing skills as rapidly and thoroughly as possible requires that we focus on the\n              weakest links in ourselves, which raises the function of the whole system most easily.\n              Since we only have so much time and energy, being strategic with these precious\n              resources is key.\n            </Text>\n            <br />\n            <Text>\n              The results of the test below should not be taken literally but as an indicator of\n              patterns. As you go through the test, notice in what areas you are strongest and in\n              what areas you are weakest. Think about how these strengths can help others around\n              you. How can you share them? In what areas do you need someone else to learn from?\n            </Text>\n          </Box>\n        </SimpleGrid>\n        <SimpleGrid columns={[1, 1, 2]} my=\"12\" spacing=\"8\">\n          <Box>\n            <Text>\n              As with all tests, the breadth and depth of what can be measured by this evaluation is\n              very limited. The point of this “test” is to help you identify areas in which you have\n              sound skills and those areas that would be most strategic to work on. Scoring your\n              evaluation should be done in the following manner:\n            </Text>\n            <br />\n            <List>\n              <ListItem>\n                <ListIcon as={FaCheckCircle} color=\"green.500\" />\n                Read the question, and think about how competent you are at the skill described.\n              </ListItem>\n              <br />\n              <ListItem>\n                <ListIcon as={FaCheckCircle} color=\"green.500\" />\n                Mark a number corresponding with that competence. This gets subjective, but do your\n                best. For instance, for the question of “Can you weld?” If you could probably cob\n                together a poor weld because you’ve tried it once, choose 'Mostly Untrue' or\n                'Moderately'. If you can do a satisfactory job with basic welding tools, choose\n                \"Mostly True\". If you can weld with an array of welding equipment very well, choose\n                \"True\".\n              </ListItem>\n            </List>\n          </Box>\n\n          <Image src={house} boxSize=\"md\" objectFit=\"cover\" alt=\"waterfall scenery\" />\n        </SimpleGrid>\n      </Container>\n\n      <Center bg=\"green.500\">\n        <Box align=\"center\" py=\"12\">\n          <Heading size=\"lg\" color=\"white\">\n            Take the Aptitude Test\n          </Heading>\n          <Button\n            mt=\"12\"\n            variant=\"outline\"\n            borderColor=\"white\"\n            color=\"white\"\n            border=\"2px\"\n            size=\"lg\"\n            _hover={{ bg: 'green.600' }}\n            onClick={onBtnClick}\n          >\n            Start Test\n          </Button>\n        </Box>\n      </Center>\n    </>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Home;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
